# Smart Home Virtual Fireplace Skill (Python)

## Instructions

In this tutorial, you will use the Alexa Smart Home Skill API to build a virtual fireplace, which will respond to your commands to power it on and off. Over the next eleven steps, you will create a skill and supporting backend resources to handle the requests from Alexa and provide responses based on user input. When complete, you will have the opportunity to continue your learning by adding additional functionality (like controlling the color, flame type, and more) to your virtual fireplace through additional code samples.
