# Continued Learning

You've [built a virtual fireplace](../instructions/README.MD) and implemented `Alexa.PowerController` to turn it on and off with your voice, now it's time to continue your learning! Follow the instructions below to implement additional Smart Home API directives, and add new capabilities to your fireplace:

* [Change the flame type with _ModeController_](ModeController/)
* [Change the number of burners in your fireplace with _RangeController_](RangeController/)
* [Change the color of the flame with _ColorController_](ColorController/)

Congratulations!
